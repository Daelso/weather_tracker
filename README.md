# 06 Web APIs: Weather Dashboard


## Description:
This homework was to create a weather dashboard that would show the current weather and a 5 day forecast for a selected city. It would also log the searched terms and allow you to click them to revisit those searches. It combines html, css, javascript, jquery, localstorage and JSON all into one while pulling data from web APIs.

I learned a lot about fetch functions and how to integrate them into various bits of code. 

For some reason, I was unable to view UV data but everything else worked just fine.
